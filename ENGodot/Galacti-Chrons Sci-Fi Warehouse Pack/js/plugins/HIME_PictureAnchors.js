 ** Description
 
 This script introduces the concept of "picture anchors". An anchor is a tool
 that fixes an object to a certain position. A picture anchor functions the
 same way: it fixes the picture to a certain position.
 
 By default, pictures are anchored to the screen. This is why no matter where
 you move, the picture always follows you.
 
 This script allows you to change the picture's anchor. You can anchor a picture
 to a character on the map so that the picture follows that character instead
 of the screen.
 
 You can also anchor the picture to a position on the map, so that the picture
 will never move from that position as long as it is anchored there. By
 anchoring a picture to the map, you can use these pictures for additional
 visual effects that you normally could not obtain using the tile editor.
 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** Installation
 
 In the script editor, place this below Materials and above Main. 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 ** Usage 
 
 Every picture has an ID. When you use the "Show Picture" command, you
 specify the ID of the picture that you want to use. You would then use this
 ID whenever you want to refer to that picture.
 
 Picture anchors work the same way: you must specify which picture the anchor
 will be applied to.
 
 Script calls are used to set anchors. There are different types of anchors.
 
   -- Screen Anchor --
   
 This is the default anchor. Pictures that are anchored to the screen will
 follow the screen. To anchor a picture to the screen, use the script call
 
   anchor_picture_to_screen(id)
   
 Where the ID is the ID of the picture.
   
   -- Map Anchor --
 
 If you would like to anchor a picture to a specific position on the map,
 use a map anchor. Use the script call
 
   anchor_picture_to_map(id, x, y)
 
 Note that the position is specified in tile coordinates, not pixel coordinates.
 
   -- Character Anchor --
   
 If you would like to anchor a picture to a character on the map, use this
 anchor. A character can be the player, an event, a follower, or a vehicle.
 Use the appropriate script call
 
   anchor_picture_to_player(id)
   anchor_picture_to_event(id, event_id)
   anchor_picture_to_follower(id, follower_num)
   anchor_picture_to_vehicle(id, vehicle_type)
   
 For followers, the first follower is the actor right behind the leader.
 For vehicles, these are the vehicles types:
 
   :ship
   :boat
   :airship
